# Polynomial-AI
This repository contains code for building a question-answering model using BERT in Google Colab. The model is designed to generate answers to questions based on a provided context. The implementation uses the Hugging Face Transformers library, NLTK for text preprocessing, and a pre-trained BERT model.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to use the code in Google Colab:

1. Open the Google Colab Notebook
Click on the provided Google Colab notebook file (question_answering_bert_colab.ipynb) to open it in Google Colab.

2. Install Required Libraries
Run the following cell in the notebook to install the necessary libraries:

Python
Copy code:
!pip install transformers nltk

3. Upload Your Document
Upload the document (document.txt) containing the context that you want to use for question answering. Make sure the document is in a readable format. Change the location as per the location of the uploaded file.

4. Run the Code Cells
Execute each code cell in the notebook. The code cells perform the following tasks:

Load the necessary libraries and download NLTK resources.
Define the preprocessing function.
Read the context from the uploaded document.
Define a list of questions.
Load the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer.
Process each question and generate answers.
5. Explore Results
Review the generated answers for each question in the notebook output. The code provides insights into how the BERT model responds to the given questions based on the provided context.

Important Notes
Ensure that your document is accessible and correctly specified in the code.
If needed, modify the list of questions to suit your specific use case.
Experiment with different contexts and questions to observe the model's behavior.
Limitations and Future Work
The provided code is a starting point for building a question-answering model. Some limitations and areas for future work include:

Lack of labeled data for evaluation.
Limited optimization and error handling.
The a potential need for a more extensive dataset.
